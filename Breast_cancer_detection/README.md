📌 Overview
This project implements a Breast Cancer Detection system using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on input features, achieving an accuracy of 98.25%.


🚀 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is used, which includes:

30 Features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)
2 Classes:
0: Benign (Non-Cancerous)
1: Malignant (Cancerous)
